On one side, you get to enjoy the intricacies of back-end development: the server, the &#8220;hidden&#8221; stuff, which people do not see but are heavily impacted by in terms of performance for example. On the other side, you get to create what the users see, what they interact with first-hand. You essentially create something palpable, which you can play with and experiment with colors and designs. You get to think from both the perspective of a developer and a user: how would I like it more if I were the user? I find both very fascinating. Whenever I think I like one more, the moment I go back to the other for even just a little bit, I&#8217;m reminded how much I enjoy that also.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[BC]: <\/strong>You joined Tech Chicago during the 2023 Internship Program, what did you find here that made you stay?\u00a0<br><strong>[CM]: <\/strong>I remember being very nervous when I joined the internship, even though it wasn&#8217;t my first one. I had to meet new people which already have friendships in place, are much more experienced than me and have more history in Tech Chicago. Fortunately, these fears disappeared in the very first days. I found a very warm and friendly collective, with amazing and talented people, which welcome you with open arms and help you with whatever you need whenever you need, without any judgement. I found a place where I can grow and develop my skills, both professional and social, and where I can learn and experience a lot of new things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[BC]: <\/strong>What has been the most challenging project you&#8217;ve worked on so far in Tech Chicago, and what made it rewarding?&nbsp;<br><br><strong>[CM]: <\/strong>I&#8217;ve only worked on one project after finishing the internship. It&#8217;s definitely been challenging especially as it is my first ever project. I had to work with new people I&#8217;ve never met before, on a project with a complex business logic, in a team where I had to learn their work practices. I had to learn and understand the code, the architecture, and how to apply my newly learned skills and knowledge. But overall, it&#8217;s been very rewarding. I met amazing people which have been patient with me, have taught me a lot of things and which I can always count on. I&#8217;m proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved ever since I joined the team<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> In the ever-evolving field of technology, how do you keep your skills sharp and stay up-to-date with industry trends?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[CM]: <\/strong>I have lots of ways in which I try to keep up with the new trends. I read an article here and there, I sometimes watch YouTube videos. But one of my most favorite and maybe unconventional way is by talking with friends or colleagues. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just us, but whenever I go out with my IT friends, we always have to talk at some point about work or IT in general. You&#8217;d be surprised how much you can learn in casual discussions like these, even about fields you&#8217;ve never worked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[BC]: <\/strong>Do you have any tips for the interns joining this year?&nbsp;<br><br><strong>[CM]: <\/strong>One tip that I have for the new interns is to socialize as much as possible: go out with people who are having their smoking break even if you do not smoke. Go to as many events as possible, be it a bowling night or a simple outing to drink. Do not be afraid to make small talk. Also, another tip that I have is to not overexert yourself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take breaks, try not to work overtime, if possible (even though I&#8217;m guilty of this), and do not be afraid of asking help if you need it. We&#8217;ve all been in your place at some point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[BC]: <\/strong>Can you share a fun fact about yourself that not many people know?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[CM]:<\/strong> One thing that not many people know is that very recently, a few months ago, I began to be interested in Formula 1. I have a racing wheel at home, and one day I tried in Forza Motorsport the circuit from a day prior, Suzuka. This, combined with a sudden increase in F1 content on my social media feeds, awakened my curiosity. Before I knew it, I decided to watch a race, which happened to be the one at Emilia-Romagna, and ever since then I&#8217;ve been hooked and haven&#8217;t missed a race. I love looking forward to the race weekends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[BC]: <\/strong>Do you have any hobby\/ activity to unwind and relax in your free time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[CM]:<\/strong> I have lots of ways in which I unwind and relax, such as listening to music, reading or spending time with my friends. One of my newest and most special hobbies that I recently got maybe like one year ago is cross-stitching, which I can describe as a combination between embroidery and pixel art. You create little Xs which form a whole picture. I love cross-stitching while watching a TV show after work or in the weekends, either at my desk or in my bed. My great-grandmother, which I never got to meet, used to cross-stitch and my living room back home is full of her creations. I like to think that she was the one that passed this hobby onto me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Loving the duality of full stack development, she joined Tech Chicago through last year&#8217;s Internship.\u00a0Besides like-minded individuals, she found a place in which to grow and develop her skills. \u00a0 Read on to get to know her!&nbsp; Bianca Cornaciu [BC]: What do you like most about full stack development and what led you to choose this [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2964,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[44],"tags":[41,115,6],"class_list":["post-2958","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-tq-vibes","tag-colleague-spotlight","tag-full-stack-development","tag-Tech Chicago"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Colleague Spotlight: Meet Claudia Munteanu, Full Stack Developer - Tech Chicago<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Loving the duality of full stack development, she joined Tech Chicago through last year&#039;s Internship.
