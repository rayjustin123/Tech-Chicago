Whether you need to fill a skills gap or ramp up your development efforts, partnering with a technical team from an external company can be a smart choice.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not all team augmentation partners are created equal. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read part<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1l9C1ZTp2c3ZEn9CW8-mhZZAGJaezEeL7ljxGWIsSIYE\/edit?usp=sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 1 of this article series here and discover the benefits and challenges of this approach.&nbsp;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make sure that you choose the best partner for your specific needs, it&#8217;s essential to follow a set of best practices. In the second part of this article, we&#8217;ll cover the top practices that enterprises should follow when looking for a technical team augmentation partner. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Define your requirements clearly<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you begin your search for a technical team augmentation partner, it&#8217;s essential to define your requirements clearly.<br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s some basic questions you should have clearly answered:<br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; What skills do I need in order to successfully complete my project? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; What specific roles do I need to fill? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; What is the expected duration of the engagement? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; What are my budget constraints?<br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; What are our security and data privacy requirements, and how will our technical partner ensure that these are met by the augmented team members?<br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are all critical questions that you need to answer before you start evaluating potential partners. Once you have a clear understanding of your requirements, you&#8217;ll be able to assess potential partners more effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Look for relevant experience<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When evaluating potential technical team augmentation partners, it&#8217;s important to look for experience that is relevant to your needs. For example, if you need to build a mobile app, you&#8217;ll want to look for a partner with a proven track record in mobile app development. If you need to develop an e-commerce platform, you&#8217;ll want to look for a partner with experience in that area. Don&#8217;t be swayed by a partner&#8217;s experience in areas that are not relevant to your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Evaluate technical skills<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When choosing a technical team augmentation partner, it&#8217;s critical to evaluate the technical skills of their team members. You&#8217;ll want to make sure that the team members have the necessary skills and experience to meet your requirements. Ask about the partner&#8217;s hiring process and how they assess technical skills. You may also want to ask for references or examples of previous work to evaluate their technical abilities.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. Assess communication skills<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clear communication is crucial for a successful team augmentation partnership. You&#8217;ll want to ensure that the partner&#8217;s team members can communicate effectively with your team members. During the evaluation process, pay attention to the partner&#8217;s communication skills.<br>Do they respond promptly to your inquiries?<br>Are they easy to understand?<br>Do they ask clarifying questions when needed?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good communication skills are an essential trait for any technical team augmentation partner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Consider cultural fit<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A successful team augmentation partnership requires more than just technical skills. It&#8217;s essential to consider cultural fit when evaluating potential partners. Look for partners who share your values and work ethic. It&#8217;s important to ensure that the partner&#8217;s team members will be able to work well with your team members. You may want to ask about the partner&#8217;s company culture, team dynamics, and work processes to evaluate cultural fit.<br><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. Review project management processes<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When working with a technical team augmentation partner, project management processes are critical. You&#8217;ll want to ensure that the partner has a proven project management process in place. Ask about their methodology, tools, and communication processes. You&#8217;ll want to make sure that they have a system for tracking progress, identifying and mitigating risks, and managing timelines.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7. Evaluate pricing and contracts<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing and contracts are another critical factor to consider when selecting a technical team augmentation partner. Look for partners who offer transparent pricing and clearly defined contracts. You&#8217;ll want to ensure that there are no hidden fees or unexpected costs. Evaluate the partner&#8217;s pricing structure and make sure that it aligns with your budget constraints.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8. Consider long-term partnerships<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, consider the potential for a long-term partnership with your technical team augmentation partner. While you may initially engage a partner for a specific project or need, a long-term partnership can offer more benefits. Look for partners who are interested in building a long-term relationship with your company. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of our most exciting projects have started from the team augmentation of our client\u2019s technical capabilities for a set project and have evolved into complex robust systems serving thousands of users and connecting a breadth of data points.
