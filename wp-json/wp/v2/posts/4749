You can start with a simple spark of inspiration and quickly turn it into something real. It\u2019s exciting, creative, and challenging all at once. Watching your work grow, evolve, and make a difference gives you a sense of pride and wonder that keeps you motivated and passionate every step of the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> <strong>What has been the most challenging project you&#8217;ve worked on so far in Tech Chicago, and what made it rewarding?\u00a0<\/strong><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[IP]:<\/strong> I have been working with Tech Quarter for seven years, and during this time, I have grown tremendously. Every year brought new lessons, and each project was rewarding in its own way. Early on, I loved being surrounded by senior colleagues who constantly discussed fascinating topics in the office\u2014their curiosity motivated me, and I learned something new every day. Later, I began organizing internships, which I found both fascinating and fulfilling. Through that experience, I discovered my passion for teaching. I was also pleased to be part of the team that implemented the new micro-frontend architecture for the frontend projects, an effort that allowed me to further expand my skills and knowledge.<br>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> <strong>What would a day in your life as a software developer\u00a0look like?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[IP]:<\/strong> I start my day at 7:00 AM with a workout at the gym. Around 9:00 or 9:30, I settle in to start work. My day is spent coding, meetings, and working with the team. Once I finish work, I sometimes meet friends or cook a meal at home to unwind. Later in the evening, I like to read \u2014either something related to software or a good novel\u2014before heading off to bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> <strong>In the ever-evolving field of technology, how do you keep your skills sharp and stay up-to-date with industry trends?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[IP]:<\/strong> I keep my skills up-to-date by doing a few things: &#8211; I follow tech blogs, newsletters, and forums to see what\u2019s new. &#8211; I take short courses and watch tutorials on new languages or tools. (Usually on udemy) &#8211; I experiment with new technologies on side projects to learn hands-on. &#8211; I attend meetups or conferences to exchange ideas and get fresh insights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> <strong>Looking towards the future, which emerging web technologies or trends are you most excited about and potentially looking to work with?<\/strong><br><strong>What are your predictions in this area for the next 3-5 years?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[IP]:<\/strong> I\u2019m excited about AI-driven web applications, where machine learning models can run right in the browser for real-time experiences. Over the next 3\u20135 years, I see more teams using technologies like WebAssembly to deliver powerful features on the client side, while serverless and edge computing make apps faster and more scalable. Overall, I believe the web will become smarter, more interactive, and even more user focused as AI continues to shape development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> <strong>What piece of advice would you give to someone aspiring to become a frontend developer?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[IP]:<\/strong> I would advise anyone aspiring to become a developer to stay curious. Let your curiosity drive you to explore new technologies, frameworks, and design trends. By constantly asking questions\u2014like how things work under the hood, why certain techniques are used, or what tools can solve specific problems\u2014you\u2019ll grow your knowledge base and become a more adaptable, well-rounded developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> <strong>Has any movie, book, or TV series sparked your interest lately?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[IP]:<\/strong> Yessss, I recently finished Glucose Revolution by Jessie Inchauspe, and I loved it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> <strong>Is there an activity that helps you relax and unwind?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[IP]:<\/strong> Yes! Spending time in nature\u2014especially going for hikes\u2014really helps me recharge over the weekend. It\u2019s a great way to clear my head and enjoy some fresh air.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]:<\/strong> <strong>Fun Fact:\u00a0Can you share a fact about yourself that not many people know?<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[IP]:<\/strong> Fun Fact: I\u2019ve never actually learned how to swim!
