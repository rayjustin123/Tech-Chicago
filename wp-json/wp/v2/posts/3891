You are rocking it! How has your experience been with us over the past year?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Zorica Boca [ZB]: <\/strong>Thank you so much for the kind wishes! It has been a year full of changes and valuable lessons. Adjusting to a new field wasn\u2019t easy, but the team here and the work environment have helped me tremendously. I\u2019ve managed to push past some of my limits, and the daily challenges have driven my continuous growth. I enjoy working in a dynamic environment and contributing to the team\u2019s success, and that\u2019s what makes me come to the office with positive energy every day, or almost every day!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]: You have made a big change in your career path, from hospitality to HR and office administration. What determined you to take this step?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[ZB]<\/strong>: Transitioning from the HORECA industry to HR and Admin was a change I had wanted for some time, but I was afraid to make it. (When it comes to myself, I tend to be quite pessimistic and probably my own biggest critic). After 15 years in the hospitality industry, I felt ready for a new challenge, one that would allow me to use the interpersonal skills I had developed, but in a different context. I believe that my skills from hospitality, such as managing unexpected situations and effective communication, have helped me adapt quickly to this new role.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]: What would a day in your life as Office and HR Admin look like? And how was a day in your life as a Receptionist?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[ZB]<\/strong>: A day as an Office and HR Admin usually begins with checking emails and organizing priority tasks. I like to ensure that the office runs smoothly and that my colleagues have everything they need to work efficiently. In addition to administrative tasks, I also handle HR-related matters, which gives me the chance to collaborate directly with colleagues and provide support. In the past, as a receptionist, my days were more focused on direct interaction with clients, managing bookings, and organizing hotel logistics. Both roles require a lot of organization and multitasking skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]: You went above and beyond to organize the team-building event, and it looks like everyone had a fantastic time! How did you find the whole planning process? Was it stressful for you?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[ZB]<\/strong>: Organizing the team-building event was a challenge I really enjoyed, even though it came with a bit of stress. My perfectionism comes into play in such situations, as I want everything to turn out perfectly. Even though there were some slightly stressful moments, my previous experience helped me manage everything efficiently. I also had incredible support from my colleagues, which made the whole process easier and more enjoyable. It was truly satisfying to see the team having a great time and to know that the event was a success!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]: What&#8217;s the most challenging thing about your role?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[ZB]<\/strong>: The biggest challenge in my role is constantly finding ways to capture my colleagues&#8217; interest through relevant events and activities. It\u2019s difficult to come up with new ideas that excite them and spark their curiosity, especially when I need to balance the diverse preferences and needs of the team. On the administrative side, the major challenge is finding suppliers and partners who are prompt and meet their deadlines, especially when urgent matters arise. I\u2019ve encountered situations where resolving administrative issues was delayed due to the lack of commitment from some individuals, which can be both frustrating and time-consuming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]:  Was there ever a time when you had to manage a high-pressure situation? How did you handle it?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[ZB]<\/strong>: Yes, I remember a recent situation when an important client was scheduled to visit, and at the same time, I was working on an urgent administrative project \u2013 there was an issue with one of the offices, where it was leaking, and I was trying to get the repairs finished. Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen circumstances, the work took longer than I had anticipated, and I also had some misunderstandings with the person in charge of the repairs. In the end, we managed to get everything done in time for the client&#8217;s visit, and this experience showed me just how essential it is to stay calm and organized in high-pressure situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]: Has any movie, book, or TV series sparked your interest lately?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[ZB]<\/strong>: Recently, I started reading\u00a0<em>Ariadne<\/em>, a book that had been on my list for a while, recommended to me by a colleague. I love getting lost in captivating stories and relaxing with fiction or light novels. Books are an excellent way for me to unwind and escape from the everyday routine. As for movies, I always enjoy a romantic comedy or a psychological thriller, but I haven\u2019t come across a title recently that has particularly caught my interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>[BC]: Is there an activity that helps you relax and unwind?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[ZB]<\/strong>: Reading is one of the activities that helps me relax the most, and getting lost in a captivating story allows me to completely disconnect. Additionally, shopping is an activity I turn to, especially when I&#8217;m feeling upset. I can easily lose track of time in a clothing store or even in one for furniture and home decor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This month, meet Zorica!
