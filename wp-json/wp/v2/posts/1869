But it was rewarding because I met wonderful people from whom I had and still have a lot to learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[BC]: Can you share an example of a particularly complex problem you&#8217;ve solved in your career, and how it impacted the project you work on?<br><\/strong><br><strong>[LM]:<\/strong> I don&#8217;t have a concrete example from my career yet, but I can say that I have encountered many problems in college that helped me understand how to manage and solve certain situations.
