It&#8217;s rewarding to craft designs that not only look great but also enhance the user experience. The process of understanding users&#8217; needs and behaviors, then translating that into intuitive interfaces, is something I find deeply fulfilling. For me, this field doesn&#8217;t feel like a traditional job. It feels more like a vocation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">[BC]: What has been the most challenging project you&#8217;ve worked on so far in Tech Chicago, and what made it rewarding?\u00a0<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[TC]: <\/strong>One of the projects that I&#8217;m currently working on has been and remains the most challenging project I&#8217;ve worked on. It has allowed me to develop my skills across various platforms. Being involved in two projects, I&#8217;ve also learned how to manage my time more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">[BC]: What would a day in your life as a UI\/UX Designer look like?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[TC]: <\/strong>As a UI\/UX Designer, my day starts with a quick check of emails and project updates. Of course, coffee is on the list :)). I spend my time collaborating with the team to determine the priorities and also to ensure that the design is feasible and consistent. Additionally, I have meetings with the client to present my work progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">[BC]: How do you keep your skills sharp and stay up to date with industry trends?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[TC]: <\/strong>Well, I have a goal for each week, to finish a chapter from a course (it also depends of the course intensity). If I don&#8217;t manage to do this, I impose a penalty by completing two chapters the following week. If by the end of the month, I achieve my goals, I reward myself with something I want or need. It works for me! \ud83d\ude00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">[BC]: Looking towards the future, which emerging web technologies or trends are you most excited about and potentially looking to work with?<br>What are your predictions in this area for the next 3-5 years?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[TC]: <\/strong>Of course, AI will be a rapidly advancing tool that can greatly enhance our work. It will also be necessary and requested by clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">[BC]: What piece of advice would you give to someone aspiring to become a UI\/UX Designer?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[TC]: <\/strong>First of all, believe in you and in your work. Focus on both technical and empathetic aspects of design. For me, never stop learning is the way to move forward. Design trends and technology are always evolving, so staying updated is essential for continuous growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">[BC]: Has any movie, book, or TV series sparked your interest lately?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[TC]: <\/strong>The last TV series I watched, was Yellowstone. After some research, I found out that it also has two prequels, titled 1883 and 1923. I highly recommend them all \ud83d\ude00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">[BC]: Is there an activity that helps you relax and unwind?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[TC]: <\/strong>I have several activities that help me relax, depending on how my day unfolds. Most of the time, I stay active through swimming, going to gym, running or taking a walk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">[BC]: Fun Fact:\u00a0Can you share a fact about yourself that not many people know?\u00a0<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[TC]: <\/strong>I initially wanted to pursue a degree in psychology but ended up studying Forestry due to limited options I had at the time. In my third year of study, I realized that it wasn&#8217;t the right path for me. This led me to return to my true passion -graphic design- where I could fully leverage my skills and creativity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making for a relaxed and fun work environment, Tudor takes his designs seriously delivering both visually appealing and functional projects.&nbsp; Colleagues say about Tudor that he is a talented designer known for his attention to detail, proactive problem-solving, and seamless collaboration between clients and development teams.&nbsp; His creativity, adaptability, and strong work ethic consistently deliver [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4993,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[44],"tags":[41,6,161],"class_list":["post-4988","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-tq-vibes","tag-colleague-spotlight","tag-Tech Chicago","tag-ui-ux-design"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.5 -
